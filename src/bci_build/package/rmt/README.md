About This Image

The Repository Mirroring Tool (RMT) for SUSE Linux Enterprise allows enterprise customers to optimize the management of SUSE Linux Enterprise software updates and subscription entitlements. It establishes a proxy system for SUSE Customer Center with repositories and registration targets. This makes it possible to manage software updates within a firewall on a per-system basis, while maintaining your corporate security policies and regulatory compliance.

RMT allows you to provision updates for all your devices running a product based on SUSE Linux Enterprise. By downloading these updates once and distributing them throughout the enterprise, you can set more restrictive firewall policies. This also reduces bandwidth usage, as there is no need to download the same updates for each device. RMT is fully supported and available as a download for customers with an active SUSE Linux Enterprise product subscription.

RMT can be deployed on top of the Kubernetes cluster using a dedicated Helm chart. For more info, see https://documentation.suse.com/sles/15/single-html/SLES-rmt/index.html#sec-rmt-deploy-kubernetes
